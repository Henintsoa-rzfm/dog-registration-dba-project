# *DOG REGISTRATION*
### Oracle database project
Welcome to the **DOG REGISTRATION** project, this is a database project using oracle.
To do the project, I used Oracle SQL Developer, but I choose a personal directory structure to make it more understandable on github. This is a personal project but it may also help beginners to get how to create, add informations on tables and how to use sequences and Triggers.
- I used *Looping* to create the design model of the project. You can find the Database model inside the docs folder or click on this link ![Database model](https://github.com/Henintsoa-rzfm/dog-registration-dba-project/blob/master/docs/database-model.png).
