# *DOG REGISTRATION*
### Oracle database project
Welcome to the **DOG REGISTRATION** project, this is a database project using oracle.
To do the project, I used Oracle SQL Developer, but I choose a personal directory structure to make it more understandable on github. This is a personal project but it may also help beginners to get how to create, add informations on tables and how to use sequences and Triggers, it also contains code to modify tables column.

**NOTICE** => This is not the finality of the project, it may change anytime. 

1. Database model :
- I used *Looping* to create the design model of the project.
